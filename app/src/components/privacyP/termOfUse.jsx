Terms of Use

Effective Date: March 21, 2024

Welcome to Cleanerino, your go-to marketplace for clean and sustainable personal, home, pet care products, and cosmetics. Cleanerino provides a marketplace for buyers to discover clean and sustainable products and purchase them directly from makers/vendors. By shopping on Cleanerino, you understand that:
You are not buying directly from Cleanerino, but from one of the vendors selling their products on Cleanerino;

Although Cleanerino does review the packaging description and ingredient lists before allowing brands to sell on the marketplace, Cleanerino does not guarantee or endorse any items sold on the marketplace or any content posted by vendors (language, imagery and claims  used in listings or shop policies);

Each vendor on Cleanerino establishes and follows their own shop policies, shipping methods, return policies, and procedures, processing times, etc. Cleanerino is not responsible for the individual policies and practices set by vendors on the platform. We recommend reviewing each vendor's policies before making a purchase or engaging in transactions. If you have any concerns or questions regarding a specific vendor's policies, please contact the vendor directly.

1. Accepting These Terms

By accessing or using Cleanerino's services, including but not limited to browsing, purchasing, or interacting with vendors or other users on the platform, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Use. These terms constitute a legally binding agreement between you and Cleanerino. If you do not agree to these Terms of Use, you may not use our services.
Please note that Section 11 contains an arbitration clause and class action waiver, applicable to users in North and South America, and explains how to opt out of arbitration. Unless you validly opt out, you agree to resolve any disputes with Cleanerino exclusively through binding individual arbitration, with only limited exceptions. This means you and Cleanerino are waiving the right to sue in court, have a trial by jury, or participate in a class or representative action. Please read this Section carefully, as it affects your rights.
These terms set out your rights and responsibilities when you use Cleanerino or services and applications provided by Cleanerino.

8. Warranties and Limitation of Liability
8.1. Products You Purchase

You understand that we at Cleanerino do not manufacture, store, or inspect the items available through our marketplace. We serve as a venue, and the products in our marketplace are created, listed, and sold directly by independent vendors. 

Consequently, Cleanerino cannot and does not provide warranties regarding the quality, safety, authenticity, or legality of these products. Any legal claims related to a product you purchase must be directed toward the vendor of that product. By using our services, you release Cleanerino from any claims connected to items sold on our platform, including those related to defective items, misrepresentations by vendors, or products causing physical injury, invoke or worsen a health condition.

8.2. Content You Access

While using Cleanerino's services, you may encounter materials that you find offensive or inappropriate. While we encourage you to report such materials to our support team, we want to make it clear that Cleanerino does not vouch for the accuracy, copyright compliance, legality, or decency of content posted by users through our services. You agree to release us from all liability relating to such content.
In the event that you request the removal or takedown of specific content due to its offensive or inappropriate nature, the request will be subject to our established content moderation process. This process ensures that content removal requests are reviewed, evaluated, and actioned in accordance with our community guidelines and applicable laws. We reserve the right to determine the appropriateness of content removal requests based on our policies and legal obligations.

8.3. Interactions with Other Users

Our services enable you to engage with other individuals, both online and in person. It's important to note that while we take measures to meet compliance and legal obligations, we do not extensively screen users of our services. By using our platform, you release us from any liability related to your interactions with other users. We strongly advise exercising caution and using good judgment in all your interactions, particularly when meeting someone in person. Your safety and well-being are important to us, and we encourage you to report any concerns or issues to our support team promptly.

8.4. Third-Party Services
Cleanerino's services may contain links to third-party websites or services that we do not own or control. You may also need to use third-party products or services to access certain features of our platform. When you access these third-party services, you do so at your own risk. These third parties may require you to accept their own terms of use, and these agreements are solely between you and that third party.

8.5. Warranties

Cleanerino is committed to delivering the best services, but we acknowledge that things may not always go perfectly. You understand that our services are provided "as is" and "as available" without any warranty, whether express or implied. We explicitly disclaim any warranties of title, non-infringement, merchantability, and fitness for a particular purpose, as well as any warranties implied by a course of performance, course of dealing, or usage of trade.

We cannot guarantee that:
The services will be secure or available at any specific time or location.
Any defects or errors will be corrected.
The services will be free of viruses or other harmful materials.
The results of using the services will meet your expectations.
Your use of the services is entirely at your own risk. Some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied warranties, so the above limitations may not apply to you.

8.6.Gift Cards and Promotions

Please acknowledge that Cleanerino does not provide warranties with respect to your Gift Card balance and is not responsible for unauthorized access, alteration, theft, or destruction of a Gift Card or Gift Card code. If your Gift Card or Gift Card code is reported lost or stolen, or if we suspect suspicious or fraudulent activity, we may suspend or prohibit its use. If a Gift Card code becomes inactive, we will issue a replacement Gift Card code. By participating in special offers or promotions, you agree not to later claim that the rules of those promotions were unclear.

8.7. Liability Limits

To the fullest extent permitted by law, neither Cleanerino (including its officers, directors, employees, agents, subsidiaries, partners, or affiliates) shall be liable to you for any lost profits or revenues, or for any consequential, incidental, indirect, special, or punitive damages arising out of or in connection with the services or these terms. In no event shall Cleanerino's aggregate liability for any damages exceed the greater of:
Either the amount of the order or $150, whichever is less.
The amount you paid Cleanerino in fees in the past 12 months prior to any action giving rise to the liability.
Some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitations may not apply to you.

9. Indemnification and Our Response to Legal Claims

While we hope it never comes to this, if Cleanerino faces a lawsuit or receives a claim, notice, or demand due to your actions (or inaction), you agree to defend and indemnify Cleanerino. This means you'll undertake to protect, reimburse, compensate, and keep Cleanerino (including our employees, officers, directors, agents, subsidiaries, and affiliates) free from any allegation, claim, demand, lawsuit, loss, liability, or expense of any kind, including reasonable attorney's fees. These may arise from your actions, your use of our Services (or misuse), your violation of the Terms, transactions involving products you buy or sell through our Services, and/or your actual or alleged infringement of any law or the rights of a third party.

We retain the right to manage our legal defense as we see fit, even if you are indemnifying us. In such cases, you agree to collaborate with us to ensure the successful execution of our legal strategy.

10. Dispute Resolution with Other Users

In the event that you find yourself in a dispute with another Cleanerino user or a third party, we recommend that you attempt to resolve the issue amicably through direct contact with the other party.
Case Resolution System: If you are unable to resolve a dispute related to a transaction on Cleanerino, our case resolution support is available for registered accounts. While Cleanerino will make a good-faith effort to assist in dispute resolution at our sole discretion, please note that we will not render judgments or determinations concerning legal matters or claims. Cleanerino is under no obligation to mediate or resolve disputes.
Release of Cleanerino: By using Cleanerino, you release us from any claims, demands, or damages that may arise from disputes with other users or third parties.

11. Dispute Resolution Mechanism and No Class Actions

In the event of a disagreement, we encourage you to reach out to us to resolve the issue amicably. However, if mutual agreement cannot be reached, you and Cleanerino (including our employees, officers, directors, agents, subsidiaries, and affiliates) agree to exclusively resolve disputes through binding individual arbitration. Neither party will file a lawsuit in court before a judge or jury, except under limited circumstances outlined below.

This Section 11, also referred to as the "Arbitration Agreement," is applicable to users in North or South America to the extent permitted by law. Please read this section carefully as it affects your rights.

A. Claims Subject to Arbitration: You and Cleanerino agree to mandatory individual arbitration for all claims arising from or related to our Services, including disputes related to these Terms and prior versions, products, data, or content bought, sold, offered, accessed, displayed, transmitted, or listed through our Services, as well as actions or statements by Cleanerino or its users. This includes disputes that arose before the effective date of these Terms. The only exceptions are (1) qualifying individual claims that can be brought in small claims court, as long as they remain in small claims court, and (2) requests for injunctive relief in court for intellectual property rights infringement or misuse, such as trademarks, copyrights, and patents. All other disputes must be arbitrated, meaning that both parties are waiving the right to sue in court and have a court or jury trial.

B. No Class or Representative Actions: You and Cleanerino agree that each party can only bring claims against the other on an individual basis, not as part of a class, representative, or collective action. Both parties waive any rights they may have to bring such claims. Each party can only seek and obtain individualized relief. Disputes between us cannot be consolidated or arbitrated with the claims of any other person or entity unless Batch Arbitration, as described in Section 11.F, applies. If a court determines that a part of Section 11.B is unenforceable for a particular claim (e.g., public injunctive relief), then that specific claim will be severed from arbitration and may be litigated in court after the arbitrator issues an award on the arbitrable claims and remedies.

C. Informal Dispute Resolution: Prior to initiating arbitration, both parties will endeavor to resolve any dispute informally and in good faith. To commence the dispute resolution process, you must send an individualized written notice ("Notice of Dispute") to info@cleanerino.com. The notice should include your name, phone number, username, and the email address associated with your account, along with a description of the dispute and proposed resolution. If Cleanerino has a dispute with you, we will send a Notice of Dispute to the email address associated with your account. Upon receiving a complete Notice of Dispute, the recipient will have 60 days to investigate the claims. During this period, if either party requests a settlement conference, both parties must cooperate to schedule the meeting, which may occur via phone or videoconference. Both parties must participate personally and may be accompanied by legal counsel. The arbitration process cannot be initiated until the Informal Resolution Period has concluded, and a court can prevent the filing or prosecution of arbitration in violation of this Section.

D. Arbitration Rules and Procedures: To initiate arbitration, either you or we must file an arbitration demand with the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"). You can serve Cleanerino with an arbitration demand by mailing it to: Cleanerino Company, 16192 Coastal Highway, city of Lewes, County of Sussex, state of Delaware 19958, United States of America. If Cleanerino has a dispute with you, we will send an arbitration demand to the email address associated with your account. In the event that the AAA is unable or unwilling to administer the arbitration in accordance with Section 11, both parties will select another arbitration provider, and if they cannot agree, a court will choose the provider.

The arbitration will be conducted in English by a single arbitrator. If an arbitration hearing is required, it will typically be held via videoconference. However, if one party requests an in-person hearing and the arbitrator agrees, an in-person hearing may be conducted in the following locations based on residency: the county of residence for US residents, Bristol County, Massachusetts, for non-US residents, or as determined by the arbitrator for Batch Arbitration cases. The arbitration process will adhere to the AAA's Consumer Arbitration Rules, with modifications as outlined in this Agreement.

For business-related disputes where either party's claims exceed $75,000, the AAA's Commercial Arbitration Rules will apply, also subject to modifications as specified in this Agreement. The arbitrator will apply relevant laws and legal counsels must adhere to the Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b). The arbitrator may impose sanctions according to the AAA Rules, Rule 11, or other applicable legal provisions. Statutes of limitations, time-based defenses, offers of judgment, compromise, and fee-shifting rules will be enforced by the arbitrator as they would in a court of law.

The arbitrator holds exclusive authority to resolve all matters, except for disputes related to arbitrability, the enforceability of Section 11, and compliance with Section 11.C, which fall within a court's jurisdiction. Except for Batch Arbitration under Section 11.F, the arbitrator can grant damages and other relief solely to the individual claimant as necessary to provide justified relief for their individual claims. The arbitrator's decisions are not bound by rulings in other arbitrations, and their awards are final and binding, enforceable in any court with jurisdiction.

E. The AAA's rules and fee schedules will determine all Arbitration Fees, covering filing, case management, administrative, hearing, and arbitrator fees, unless otherwise stated in this Agreement.

F. Batch Arbitration

To ensure efficient dispute resolution, if 25 or more claimants submit Notices of Dispute or file arbitrations within a 90-day period, all with similar claims based on the same or similar facts, events, and legal issues, and are represented by the same or coordinated counsel, these disputes will be processed in batches of up to 50 claimants each ("Batch"). Upon notification by either party, the claimants will be organized as follows:
If there are 25-50 claimants, they will form a single Batch.
If there are more than 50 claimants, they will be divided into Batches of 50 claimants each, with a smaller final Batch for any remaining claimants.
Subsequently, each Batch will undergo consolidated arbitration with a single arbitrator appointed by the American Arbitration Association (AAA), one set of Arbitration Fees, and one hearing (if necessary) per Batch, either via videoconference or at a location determined by the arbitrator. Both parties will collaborate in good faith to facilitate this process and reduce the time and costs associated with arbitration. Challenges to administrative determinations by the AAA will be reviewed by a single process arbitrator. If this Section is deemed unenforceable for a particular claimant or Batch, it will be severed for that claimant or Batch, and those parties will proceed to arbitrate in individual proceedings.

G. Opt Out

You have a limited opportunity to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement (excluding Section 11.I). New users can opt out within 30 days after first accepting the Terms, while existing users can opt out within 30 days after the effective date (listed above). To opt out, please send an email to info@cleanerino.com within the specified timeframe, including your name, email address associated with your account, username, and, if applicable, your shop name, with a request to opt out of arbitration. If you validly opt out, neither Cleanerino nor you will be required to arbitrate under this Arbitration Agreement. 
However, the Terms and other agreements between us will continue to apply. Updates to the Terms after a valid opt-out will not provide a new opportunity to opt out of arbitration.

H. Future Changes to the Arbitration Agreement

Cleanerino will provide notice of significant changes to this Arbitration Agreement at least 30 days before they take effect. You have the option to reject future changes to the Arbitration Agreement by sending an email to info@cleanerino.com within 30 days of receiving the notice. Please include your name, the email address associated with your account, and your Cleanerino account(s) in the email. If you do not reject the changes within this 30-day period, you will be bound by the updated terms, and the modified Arbitration Agreement will apply to all disputes between you and Cleanerino, including those arising before the effective date of the changes, except for claims already pending in arbitration or court, if permitted, at the time of the change. Should you reject a change, you will continue to be bound by the most recent version of the Arbitration Agreement before the rejected change.

I. Choice of Law and Forum

Cleanerino is headquartered in Attleboro, MA, so if disputes arise between you and Cleanerino that are not subject to arbitration, both parties agree to resolve these claims exclusively in the state or federal courts located in the state of Massachusetts, and submit to the personal jurisdiction of these courts. However, if you file a claim in small claims court, you may do so in the county of your residence. Except where prohibited by law, these Terms and all disputes between us will be exclusively governed by the laws of the state of Massachusetts, without regard to conflict-of-law rules, and any applicable federal laws. This Section 11.I will continue to apply even if you validly opt out of arbitration under Section 11.G.

12. Dispute Resolution - Rest of the World

This Section 12 applies if your primary residence or establishment is in regions outside North and South America, such as Europe (including the European Economic Area, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom), Asia, Australia, or Africa. Since your agreement is with Cleanerino, we mutually consent that the Terms and any disputes between us will be governed exclusively by the laws of the state of Massachusetts, United States, and disputes will be settled exclusively in the courts of the state of Massachusetts, United States, unless prohibited by applicable law. If you are an individual consumer, you retain the right to invoke mandatory consumer protection laws of your country of residence and bring legal proceedings in its courts. If Cleanerino needs to enforce its rights against you as an individual consumer, we will do so solely in your country of residence. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG) is expressly excluded.

In the event of a dispute between you and Cleanerino, we encourage you to contact Cleanerino Support to seek a resolution, and/or to follow the Informal Dispute Resolution process described in Section 11.C above.

13. Changes to the Terms and Conditions

We may periodically update these Terms, which may include adding entirely new terms and removing existing ones. If these changes are substantial, we will provide advance notice by posting them through the Services and/or sending you an email or message detailing the adjustments. Your continued use of the Services after the effective date of these changes signifies your acceptance of the updated Terms. If you disagree with these changes, you have the option to close your account.

14. Additional Legal Considerations

The Terms, along with all the policies that constitute the Terms, take precedence over any other agreement between you and Cleanerino concerning the Services. With the exception of Section 11, if any part of the Terms is found to be invalid or unenforceable, that portion will be restricted to the minimum extent necessary and severed to ensure the Terms otherwise remain in full force and effect. Our failure to enforce any part of the Terms does not waive our right to later enforce that or any other part of the Terms. We reserve the right to assign any of our rights and obligations under the Terms.

15. Contact Information

If you have questions regarding the Terms, please reach out to us via email at info@cleanerino.com and include “Terms” in the subject line of your email.
