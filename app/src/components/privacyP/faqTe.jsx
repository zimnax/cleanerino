What is Cleanerino?

Cleanerino is a marketplace that connects consumers with producers of clean and sustainable personal, home, pet care products and cosmetics.
P.S. Have you seen Ratatouille? It means “Sparkling clean!”

How is Cleanerino different from other clean product platforms?

We carefully evaluate product ingredients, packaging sustainability, and brand practices to ensure only safe, clean, and sustainable products make it onto our platform. This includes banning harsh chemicals, promoting recyclable or compostable packaging, and partnering with brands committed to sustainable production. We do this to ensure the products you buy on Cleanerino will work for your unique needs.


How is Cleanerino different from other clean product stores?
We have a robust vetting process in places to ensure that only truly clean, safe, and sustainable products make it to the marketplace. We evaluate the following to determine whether a product is a good fit for our platform:
Product ingredients
No harsh chemicals, such as parabens, SLS, phthalates, ingredients linked to disease or otherwise harmful to the human body or the planet are permitted.
Packaging
We are working hard to ensure that products listed on Cleanerino are recyclable or compostable in most locations across the United States. In the nearest future, you will be able to choose to see only products that come in packaging that can be recycled in your zipcode.
Brand 
From small independent makers to large brands, we ensure that they adhere to sustainable production and sourcing practices and refrain from processes harmful to the environment. 

How to make the most of Cleanerino’s customization?
To ensure the products you see fit your skin needs, allergy profile, and personal preferences, use the filters on the website to customize your feed without registering or create a profile to save information about your allergies, ingredient preferences, etc. In that way, you will only see the products that fit your personal needs. You can also save search preferences to find the options you need faster next time.

How do I know what’s recyclable in my area?
Create a profile and add your zipcode to see products that come in packaging that can be recycled or composted in your area. Use the recycling instructions as a guidance, but consult local recycling programs for directions in case of doubt.

Can I pick up my purchase from the vendor directly if we live in the same city?
If a vendor offers order pick-up, you will be able to choose this option at check-out. The pick-up address will be listed on your order confirmation, and once the order is processed, the vendor will be in touch to agree on the pick-up day and time.

Do you offer free shipping?
As a marketplace, Cleanerino connects customers with vendors of clean products. Each vendor may have their own shipping policy. Please refer to individual vendor pages to check their shipping policy and free shipping requirements.

What are Cleanerino’s sustainability criteria?

Our sustainability criteria take into account three key areas: ingredients, packaging, and brand.

What are Cleanerino’s sustainability criteria?
We study each product’s ingredients and packing to determine whether they meet the following criteria:

Ingredients

Human safety
A product doesn’t contain harsh chemicals
Neither of the ingredients is linked to disease or is known to cause negative health effects

Environmental impact
Ingredients are not known to harm the environment during growing, sourcing, or production
Ingredients are not linked to harmful and unsustainable practices, such as child labor or unfair use of labor
Ingredients are not known to contaminate or otherwise cause negative environmental effects while used and disposed of (e.g. not harmful to waterways, air or wildlife)

How do I know the product I’m buying is clean and safe to use?
We rigorously check the ingredient lists to ensure products only contain ingredients that are safe for the human body and the environment. By studying the formulations, our experts determine the concentrations of ingredients safe and beneficial for each skin skin type and condition. We recommend that you list any allergies and sensitivities you have in your profile to ensure you only see products that have the lowest likelihood of triggering those conditions. Given that we rely on self-reported data, in case of doubt, we encourage you to opt for products that are duly certified as such that are not expected to have a negative effect on your condition.

How do I know my order’s been shipped?

When your order’s been shipped, you will receive an email notification to confirm order shipment and a tracking link. You can also check your order status in your Cleanerino dashboard.

Clean, safe and sustainable (link to sustainability criteria)
It is not enough to be organic or clean for a product to be featured on Cleanerino. The product formulation needs to be safe and stable as well as contain responsibly sourced ingredients. The products sold on Cleanerino are clean and sustainable, inside and out. Each item listed on the marketplace is compliant with our sustainability criteria for ingredients and packaging. 


Uniquely customized
Everyone’s body is different, but we all want our personal care products to work for us. We take into account individual skin and hair types, allergies and sensitivities to curate a feed of products that will be unique to every customer.

Finding producers in your area
There are producers of high-quality personal care products in nearly every town. There probably are a few within 5 miles from your home. Small independent makers use the best ingredients and tend to know their suppliers personally.  Cleanerino exists to make it easier for customers to find local producers. Buying locally does not only help cut transportation emissions, but also supports your local economy.

Prioritizing small independent makers
For sustainable product producers, especially for new and niche ones, reaching customers can be difficult. Both online and offline retailers tend to prioritize established brands that not always sustainable. We’ve simplified the registration process and removed high fee barriers for vendors to be able to reach their customers online. To make it easier for you to support specific brands and underrepresented communities, we’re designed a system of tags and filters, so you can purchase from a small maker that supports causes you care about.
